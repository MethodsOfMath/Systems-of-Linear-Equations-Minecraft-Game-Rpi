# Systems-of-Linear-Equations-Minecraft-Game-Rpi
A game for practicing solving systems of linear equations for Minecraft Pi Edition.

On Raspian: open Minecraft, make a new world or load a world you don't mind destroying, Open something that runs Python, like IDLE and run the .py scripts.

On block examples, the red blocks are negative and the blue blocks are positive. Numbers are rounded to whole numbers. Fractions are not displayed. Blocks are displayed based on the position of the player when the script begins to run. Ensure you are in a good location before running the script. You can move around after the grid starts generating.
